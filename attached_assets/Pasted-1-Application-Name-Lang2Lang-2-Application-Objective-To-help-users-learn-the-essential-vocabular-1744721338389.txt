1. Application Name: Lang2Lang
2. Application Objective:
To help users learn the essential vocabulary and phrases for day-to-day situations in a foreign language.
Focus on high-frequency words and sentences (the "80%" that are most commonly used).
Support both new language learners and those who want to refresh their basic language skills.
Teach practical communication, not exhaustive language knowledge.
3. Core Features:
Sentence-Based Learning: Lessons revolve around full sentences, not isolated words.
Interactive Word Exploration:
Users can click on any word in a sentence to see its definition and usage explanation.
Contextual information, including grammatical notes (e.g., noun classes, verb tenses), is provided.
A chat box allows users to ask further questions about the word.
Interactive Fill-in-the-Blanks:
Each sentence has two missing words.
Users can:
Type their answer directly.
Click a "Hint" button for a brief clue.
Click an "Options" button to select from a list of 8 possible words.
Immediate feedback:
Correct answer: Displayed in blue.
Incorrect answer: User's answer displayed in red with a strikethrough, correct answer in green.

Approximately 14 exchanges per person (1-2 sentences each).

5. Technical Considerations (Implicit):
The application does not need to store any data. The only memory needed should already be in the context of the existing user (e.g. the current lesson if the user wants to repeat it)
A user interface (UI) with interactive elements (buttons, input fields, clickable words, chat section to learn more about specific words) is needed.
The design should be modular and extensible to support new languages and lessons.
The basic version of the application does not need login and does not need to be tied to specific users
